1. Add Employee:

Allow administrators to add new employee records by providing a form to input basic information such as name, contact details, job title, department, and employment status.
2. Read Employee:

Provide a user-friendly interface to view and search for employee records. Implement features like filtering, sorting, and pagination for managing a large number of records.
3. Update Employee:

Enable administrators to modify employee details. This includes the ability to edit personal information, job title, department, and update employment status.
4. Delete Employee:
